# Flight Price Prediction

Flight Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of airline tickets. 
The project utilizes various data features such as airline, departure city, arrival city, departure time, arrival time, and other relevant details to provide accurate price forecasts.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation needed to understand, reproduce, and extend the model for flight price prediction.

## Features

### Data Collection
- Scripts and notebooks to scrape or collect flight price data from various sources.

### Data Preprocessing
- Techniques to clean and preprocess the data.
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features.
- Feature scaling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the distribution and relationships of the data features.

### Model Training
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting

### Model Evaluation
- Metrics and methods to evaluate the performance of the models:
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared Score

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Techniques to optimize model parameters using:
  - Grid Search
  - Random Search

### Prediction
- Scripts to make predictions on new data.
- Visualizations of the predicted prices.

### Usage
1. Prepare the dataset using the data collection scripts.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Explore the dataset using the EDA scripts.
4. Train the models using the provided training scripts.
5. Evaluate the models and tune their hyperparameters.
6. Use the prediction scripts to predict flight prices on new data.
