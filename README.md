Overview

Flight Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of airline tickets.

The project utilizes various data features such as airline, departure city, arrival city, departure time, arrival time, and other relevant details to provide accurate price forecasts. 

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation needed to understand, reproduce, and extend the model for flight price prediction.

Features

Data Collection: 
Scripts and notebooks to scrape or collect flight price data from various sources.

Data Preprocessing: 
Techniques to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the distribution and relationships of the data features.

Model Training: 
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting for training predictive models.

Model Evaluation: 
Metrics and methods to evaluate the performance of the models, including RMSE, MAE, and R-squared scores.
